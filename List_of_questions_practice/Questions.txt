1. Reverse a linked list (iterative + recursive)

Classic test of pointer anatomy. Interviewers adore watching you juggle prev, curr, and next.

2. Detect and remove loop in linked list (Floyd’s Cycle algorithm)

Shows fluency with fast/slow pointers; you’ve been working on this already.

3. Implement your own strlen(), strcpy(), strcmp()

Tests pointer arithmetic and string termination logic.

4. Reverse a string in place

Mutating arrays safely without losing the null terminator.

5. Count bits set to 1 in an integer (population count)

Good test of bitwise operators. Variants: count trailing zeros, isolate lowest set bit.

6. Swap two integers without a temporary variable

Usually done with XOR. Interviewers use this to check bitwise comfort, not to torture you.

7. Implement a simple circular buffer

Embedded gold. Used in UART, audio buffering (ToneTag), BLE stacks.

8. Debouncing logic simulation (in C)

They may not ask full hardware debounce, but state-machine logic is common.

9. Implement a state machine (Moore/Mealy)

Every embedded profile uses state machines eventually.

10. Find endianness of the system

Write a small snippet using a pointer cast to test little vs big endian.

11. Reverse bits of an 8-bit/32-bit integer

Shows bit manipulation precision.

12. Implement memcpy(), memset(), or memmove()

Demands pointer increment/decrement, overlap handling (memmove).

13. Remove duplicates from an array (in-place)

Tests array manipulation without malloc.

14. Implement a simple stack and queue using arrays

Fixed-size buffers → classic embedded constraint.

15. Check if a number is power of 2

One-line bitwise trick.

16. Find missing number in array

Often asked in C rounds as a check on XOR reasoning.

17. Write a function to compute CRC-8 or checksum

Medium difficulty; relevant to IoT and communication protocols.

18. Implement binary search

Tests correctness, boundary handling, integer overflow (mid calculation).

19. Design a lightweight scheduler

Sometimes they ask an extremely small cooperative scheduler using function pointers.

20. Implement your own atoi() and itoa()

Bound checking + arithmetic + ASCII handling.
